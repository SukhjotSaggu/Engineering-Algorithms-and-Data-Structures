Lab 3:

1.I have completed both of the sorting methods Insertion Sort and Merge Sort. Both methods function correctly.

2.Equations for Insertion Sort:
	Best Case:
		Copy: 2n
		Swaps: 0
		Comparison: n-1
	Average Case:
		Copy: (n(n-1)/2)+2n
		Swaps: 0
		Comparison: n(n-1)/2
	Worst Case:
		Copy: n(n-1)/2
		Swaps: 0
		Comparison: (n(n-1)/2)+2n

  Equations for Merge Sort:
	Best Case:
		Copy: 0
		Swaps: 0
		Comparison: n log n
	Average Case:
		Copy: n-1
		Swaps: 0
		Comparison: n log n
	Worst Case:
		Copy: n-1
		Swaps: 0
		Comparison: n(log n)-2^(log n)+1
	The number of Copy and Swap varys based on the inputed data for this sorting method
