Q1. The initial invocation whould be:
	towers(5,2,3)
Then the first recusive step to towers() would be inkoked as:
	towers(4,2,1)

Q2. 5 recusive steps will have taken place before this first rcusive call actually retuns to the initial invocation.

Q3. Once the first recusive call to tower() is made the statement printed to stdout will be:
	2 3
where 2 is the "from" tower and 3 is the "destination" tower.

Q4. The second recusive step to towers() would be inkoked as:
	towers(0,1,3)

Question: Suppose that towers(8, 1, 2) is invoked. How many lines will be printed to stdout?
	There will be 255 lines printed to stdout as (2^n)-1 movers are requried to move n number of 	disks between 2 give towers.
